          <p>
            The purpose of this Disaster Recovery Plan is to outline procedures
            for RSO Consulting to respond to significant disruptions in
            operations, specifically tailored for a fully remote workforce. This
            plan focuses on restoring access to critical cloud-based
            applications, ensuring data integrity, and minimizing downtime.

            <li>
              <b>Data Restoration:</b> Initiate data recovery from cloud
