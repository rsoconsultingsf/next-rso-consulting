          </h2>
          <h3>
            <b>a) Incident Response Team (IRT)</b>
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Roles and Responsibilities:</b> Define an Incident Response
              Team comprising employees from relevant departments (IT, legal,
              HR, communications, etc.). Each member should have specific roles:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Incident Response Manager:</b> Oversees the incident, makes
                  critical decisions, and coordinates the team&apos;s efforts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>IT Security:</b> Leads technical analysis and remediation
                  of the breach.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Legal:</b> Ensures compliance with applicable laws and
                  regulations.

                  <b>Communications:</b> Manages customer notifications,
                  internal communications, and media inquiries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>HR and Operations:</b> Handles internal employee-related
                  issues and coordinates with relevant operational teams.

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            <b>b) Identification of a Breach</b>
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Monitoring and Detection Systems:</b>Monitoring and Detection
              Systems: Ensure the company has tools and systems to detect
              potential data breaches in real-time, including intrusion
              detection systems, monitoring logs, and security audits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Incident Reporting Mechanism:</b>Incident Reporting Mechanism:
              Develop an internal reporting procedure so employees can easily
              report suspected incidents. Encourage employees to immediately
              notify the IRT if they suspect unauthorized access or data
              breaches.

            <li>
              <b>Containment:</b> Upon detecting a breach, immediately isolate
              affected systems and networks to prevent further data loss.
              Depending on the nature of the breach, actions might include
              shutting down servers, disabling compromised user accounts, or
              restricting network access.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Initial Analysis:</b> Conduct a preliminary investigation to
              determine the scope of the breach. This involves identifying:
              <ul>
                <li>How the breach occurred.</li>
                <li>
                  What data was affected (e.g., customer personal data,
                  confidential information).
                </li>
                <li>The timeline of the breach.</li>

            <li>
              <b>Eradication:</b> Identify and eliminate the cause of the
              breach, whether it’s malware, vulnerabilities, or a compromised
              account. Ensure all backdoors, unauthorized access points, or
              malicious code are completely removed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>System Restoration:</b> Restore systems and data from backups
              if necessary, ensuring that all compromised systems are cleaned
              and secured before bringing them back online.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Monitoring:</b> Implement enhanced monitoring post-incident to
              detect any follow-up attacks or persistent threats.
